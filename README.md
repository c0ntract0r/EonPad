# Eonpad

Eonpad is a lightweight and simple note-taking hierarchical application, created as my first fullstack Application. My main motivation came from [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/).

## Features
* **Note Management:** Create, read, update, delete notes.
* **Hierarchical Folders:** Notes can be organized in a folder structure with parent-child relationships. You can choose, whether to recursively delete everything inside a folder, or just delete the parent folder, without affecting child objects.
* **Open source:** Free to use, modify, and self-host under your needs.
* **Cloud storage:** You can store your notes in cloud, and access them from anywhere.

## Status
Currently: Backend API is at almost-ready state, while frontend is being developed. Any help regarding the code and constructive criticism will be much appreciated. I'm sharing this to get feedback regarding my API and schema design choices, improve security & quality while working on frontend.

## Setup

## Licence


*Disclaimer: When I fully finish this project, there will be no charging for storing notes in cloud, but please, be aware: If by some magic, more people start using this, I will continue the development, and hence, there will be introduced a small monthly subscription for about 0.99$ for a month for keeping notes. But, before that, you buying me a coffee will be very much helpful and keep me  motivated :D*
