# Eonpad

Eonpad is a lightweight and simple note-taking hierarchical application, created as my first fullstack Application. My main motivation came from [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/). If you are looking for a comprehensive note solution, where many people have contributed on one project, this is not for you. Look for alternatives.

## Features
* **Note Management:** Create, read, update, delete notes.
* **Hierarchical Folders:** Notes can be organized in a folder structure with parent-child relationships. You can choose, whether to recursively delete everything inside a folder, or just delete the parent folder, without affecting child objects.
* **Open source:** Free to use, modify, and self-host under your needs.
* **Cloud storage:** You can store your notes in cloud, and access them from anywhere.

## Status
Backend API is completely ready, even to the point I can say it is ready to be published to the world, but the Frontend remains unfinished for unknown period of time. Maybe I will be back to it. But even in that state, a lot is ready: The landing page, login/registration logic, route protection, dashboard UI, some backend calls, state management, etc...
